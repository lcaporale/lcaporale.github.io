My favorite code quote, "<span id="k">It does not matter how fast it is done, if it is not correct</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! I am Luke Caporale.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

<p>This is my portfolio website. I am putting together a quick introduction page that will link to other web projects I work on along with links to some of my social media profiles. It has been pretty cool learning to do this!</p>

<p>I am a follower of Christ and am passionate about doing all that I do with the highest quality possible to honor Him.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>I have spent most of my career in the construction industry and starting off working in remodeling with my father who is a master home builder. I then moved on to hold mutliple positions at a Tile distribution company called Best Tile.</p>

<p>I love playing music, drama, reading, Theology and have enjoyed dabbling a bit with web programming.</p>
