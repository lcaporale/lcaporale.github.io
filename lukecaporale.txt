Hey There! I am Luke Caporale.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

<p>This is my portfolio website. I am putting together a quick introduction page that will link to other web projects I work on along with links to some of my social media profiles. It has been pretty cool learning to do this!</p>

<p>I am a follower of Christ and am passionate about doing all that I do with the highest quality possible to honor Him.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->

<p>I have spent most of my career in the construction industry and starting off working in remodeling with my father who is a master home builder. I then moved on to hold mutliple positions at a Tile distribution company called Best Tile.</p>

<p>I love music, drama, literature, theology and have enjoyed dabbling a bit with web programming. Right now I have been exploring my interests and would like to one day find a way to combine some of these various interests together in a project of some sort.</p>

<p>Links to my projects? <a href="link"> Here you go</a>.</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
