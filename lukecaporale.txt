My favorite quote, "<span id="k">There is no pit so deep, that God's love is not deeper still. Corrie Ten Boom</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! I am Luke Caporale.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->

<p>I want to quickly introduce myself and provide some links to any future web projects I work on. I also will provide you with links to some of my social media profiles if you would like to connect with me.</p>

<p>I am a follower of Christ and am passionate about doing all that I do with the highest quality possible to honor Him. Colossians 3:17 says, "And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him." NKJV
It is my desire to live this verse out in such a way that others will be able to see God's love through me and be drawn to Him.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->

<p>I have spent most of my career in the construction industry and started off working in remodeling with my father who is a home builder. I then moved on to hold multiple positions at a Tile distribution company called Best Tile where I have gained experience in business operations, sales and project management.</p>

<p>I love music, acting, literature, storytelling, theology and have enjoyed dabbling a bit with web programming! I also am interested in science, math, accounting and project management. I am still exploring my interests and would like to find a way to combine a few of them into a collaborative project of some sort. Maybe, a multimedia blog? I am not sure at this point. </p>
